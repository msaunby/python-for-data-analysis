    "# Python for Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "This course provides an in-depth exploration of Python for data analysis, focusing on essential libraries and tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly. ~~Additionally, it covers critical software development practices, including testing, virtual environments, and version control, to ensure code reproducibility and collaboration in research projects.~~ By the end of the course, participants will be adept at performing data manipulation, analysis, and visualisation tasks, ~~and will have a solid understanding of maintaining and sharing their code efficiently.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Objectives\n",
    "- ~~Grasp the fundamentals of Python programming, including data types, control structures, and functions.~~\n",
    "- Learn to use NumPy for numerical operations and handling large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "- Learn how to load, clean, and manipulate data using Pandas for effective data analysis.\n",
    "- Understand the use of Pandas for handling research problem datasets.\n",
    "- Create a variety of static and interactive visualisations to represent data insights, covering Matplotlib and Plotly.\n",
    "- Apply machine learning techniques using Scikit-Learn for predictive modelling.\n",
    "- ~~Implement testing framework, manage dependencies with virtual environment.~~\n",
    "- ~~Learn methods to ensure that research and analyses can be reproduced and validated by other.~~\n",
